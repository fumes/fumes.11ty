The concept of meaning starts with emptiness. It is like an empty bowl.


{% include partials/image.html, name: "-110604_photo_rokma__MG_1109" %}

You may fill an empty bowl with whatever you may wish – whether it be rice, fruit or soup – and yet it is impartial to its contents.


{% include partials/image.html, name: "-110716_photo_rokma__MG_2172" %}

And after you fill your bowl you soon empty it again.


{% include partials/image.html, name: "-170615_photo_rokma_surf_please" %}

You ingest its contents, let them nourish you, and then the next day fill your bowl with something else and repeat the process all over again.


{% include partials/image.html, name: "-161209_photo_rokma__MG_8782" %}

Most of the time however, the bowl stays empty. And so it is with meaning.


{% include partials/image.html, name: "-100405_photo_rokma__MG_4595" %}

It starts out as an empty bowl, but people are uncomfortable with emptiness.


{% include partials/image.html, name: "-110413_photo_rokma__MG_9072" %}

They like things they can conceptualise.


{% include partials/image.html, name: "-120311_photo_rokma__MG_9557" %}

Things they can _feel_.


{% include partials/image.html, name: "-120310_photo_rokma__MG_9414" %}

So they quickly fill their empty bowl of meaning with whatever happens to come along, or with whatever makes them feel good.



{% include partials/image.html, name: "-080224_photo_rokma__MG_2093" %}

This is fine, but the problem is most people just leave their acquired meaning in the bowl. They never fully ingest its contents and let them nourish themselves.



{% include partials/image.html, name: "-090629_photo_rokma__MG_7453" %}

The bowl never goes back to being empty. It never gets the chance to be filled with anything else... something _different_.



{% include partials/image.html, name: "-100313_photo_rokma__MG_3615" %}

And just like rice in a bowl that never gets eaten gets rotten and stale, so does uningested meaning.



{% include partials/image.html, name: "-080715_photo_rokma__MG_7736" %}

The beauty of meaning is the fact that it may be whatever you wish. There is _no_ intrinsic meaning of anything.



{% include partials/image.html, name: "-080831_photo_rokma__MG_0856" %}

You may fill your bowl again and again with different substance. You may find different
meanings for the same thing and this is just fine. No contradiction needs to occur.



{% include partials/image.html, name: "-100512_photo_rokma__MG_7485" %}

Moreover, the treasures with which you may fill your bowl of meaning are unlimited.



{% include partials/image.html, name: "-100604_photo_rokma__MG_9207" %}

They are plentiful and boundless, and as deep as the dark blue sea. They can be positive, negative, or both at the same time.



{% include partials/image.html, name: "-100912_photo_rokma__MG_0017" %}

But don’t ever let your treasures of meaning go to waste. Never let them go stale. Ingest these treasures, let them nourish your being.



{% include partials/image.html, name: "-110729_photo_rokma__MG_2459" %}

Then let the bowl go back to being empty, without being uncomfortable about the emptiness.



{% include partials/image.html, name: "-090711_photo_rokma__MG_7851" %}

In fact, if you truly understand this, the emptiness is liberating.
