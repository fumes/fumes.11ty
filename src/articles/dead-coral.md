Once alive and full of colors, when dead corals slowly turn to white.


The <a title="read about the coral triangle" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_Triangle"  >abundance</a> of coral types and the shapes of <a title="more infos on coral reef" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_reef"  >coral reefs</a> they form is quite surprising.

The <a title="The Structure and Distribution of Cora Reefs" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_and_Distribution_of_Coral_Reefs"  >structure</a>, the form, its strength are all an <a title="watch a movie about Raja Ampat, Indonesia - Scuba diving in paradise" href="http://youtu.be/dMldSFwXTfU"  >astonishing</a> architecture work.

One of the most critical distinctions between plants and animals is that plants make their own food, while animals depend on outside sources for their nutritional requirements. <a title="watch a movie about Coral Reef Adventure" href="http://youtu.be/jQj5pg0x2VU"  >Coral animals </a>take advantage of both forms of nutrition by hosting plant-like algae in their tissues in a symbiotic relationship.

Coral grows <a title="read more on Deep water corals" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep-water_coral"  >mostly</a> in shallow waters. When it naturally dies is crushed by the sea to form sand. Also <a title="read about coral bleaching" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_bleaching"  >pollution</a>, anchoring, bomb fishing and climate change contribute to its <a title="Aquaculture is showing promise as a potentially effective tool for restoring coral reefs" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_aquaculture"  >destruction</a>.

All the pieces of coral shown here have been collected in the Tuban beach near the airport of Bali, <a title="read more on Southeast Asian coral reefs" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asian_coral_reefs"  >Indonesia</a>.

Here people sometimes use big chunk of coral to build walls. Its a free locally available stone-like hard material mainly composed of calcium carbonate.
