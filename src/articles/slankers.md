Formed in 1983, Slank is an Indonesian superband. By numbers, they are the biggest indie band in the world. Known for their socio-politically driven music, they were censored from TV and Radio during the Suharto years.

Slank's loyal following are known as "Slankers". Considering that over 50% of Indonesia's population is under the age of 25, and that the arrival of democracy and overthrow of Suhatro's dictatorship fell at the hands of a student led youth campaign, Slank is a powerful force in the Indonesian socio-political landscape.

Slank  concerts have a feeling of a grassroots jam session combined with a passionate political demonstration.
