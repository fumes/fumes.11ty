Zhuang Zhou, often written Chuang Tzu, known for Zhuangzi ("Master Zhuang")[1] was an influential Chinese philosopher who lived around the 4th century BC.

He is credited with writing the Zhuangzi book, which expresses a philosophy of skepticism.

He made "The Old Fisherman," "The Robber Chih," and "The Cutting open Satchels," to satirize and expose the disciples of Confucius, and clearly exhibit the sentiments of Lao.
