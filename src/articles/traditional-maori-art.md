The **Museum of New Zealand, Te Papa Tongarewa** is a governmental institution to promote art in Wellington. They focus on "Changing hearts, minds, and lives."

Te Papa’s vision for the future is to change hearts, minds, and lives being a forum for the nation to present, explore, and preserve the heritage of its cultures and knowledge of the natural environment. Te Papa was established with this role by the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa Act 1992.

Te Papa has a strong a  strong commitment to biculturalism through iwi (tribal) exhibitions, _wānanga_ (workshops), and other initiatives.

NSTP aims to strengthen the museum sector by providing practical and strategic help to museums, galleries, and iwi tribes throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. Te Papa does this through training, resources, funding grants, advice, and collaborative opportunities including hui gatherings.

The Iwi Exhibition Programme gives iwi (tribes) the chance to present their _taonga_ (treasures) and stories in a national forum. The programme is an important expression of _mana taonga_ – the role of communities in the understanding and care of collections. This concept underpins Te Papa’s guardianship of all taonga (treasures).

Iwi in residence. Each _iwi_ (tribe) works collaboratively with Te Papa to create an exhibition. During the exhibition’s run, _kaumātua_ (elders) reside at Te Papa and carry out a range of roles, including ceremonial duties on _Te Marae_.

Where should an exhibition of New Zealand art begin? The works here present different visions of art In Aotearoa New Zealand and reveal ripples of inspiration and cross-cultural exchange flowing to and from the Pacific shores.

These photos show Samoan men receiving tatau from _tufuga tatatau_ (master tatto0ist) **Su'a Tavui Pasina losefo Ah Ken**.

In 1978, **Mark Adams** photographed a Samoan man with a _pe'a_ (customary waist-to-knee tattoo) in a suburban Auckland villa. The incongruity struck Adams, was he in Polynesia or New Zealand? He said of the encounter;
>"the stranger in the frame was me, not him. He already knew he was in Polynesia... I was the exotic in the frame."
