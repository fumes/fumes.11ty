description: "Calling Balinese painting traditional misrepresents the dynamics and highly innovative nature of painting in Bali. Tradition implies lack of change, adherence to set types. While both the old tradition of classical Kamasan painting and the new tradition of modern art that developed in the 1930s work from such set types, they allow for a high degree of change."

>"Erotic situation are a favourite theme of the Batuan painters and a subject
requested by their art dealers and buyers. At the beginning, eros was usually not a central theme, but was hidden away in quiet corners of paintings. Under a small three for examples, or inside a cottage in the fields. Sometimes eros was implicit in mythological imagery and only apparent to those who were familiar with its visual code. Increasingly erotic situations are shown as subjects in themselves, usually surrealistic, often humorous, and almost always very explicit." - Bruce Granquist - Inventing Art The Paintings of Batuan Bali, 2016, page 230

>"Calling Balinese painting 'traditional' misrepresents the dynamics and highly innovative nature of painting in Bali. 'Tradition' implies lack of change, adherence to set types. While both the old tradition of classical Kamasan painting and the new tradition of modern art that developed in the 1930s work from such set types, they allow for a high degree of change. Innovation takes place In Balinese tradition through imitation. Each artist copies the works of other, but introduces elements both his or her own making that are
connected to social and cultural changes." - Adrian Vickers - Balinese Art Paintings and Drawings of Bali, page 26
