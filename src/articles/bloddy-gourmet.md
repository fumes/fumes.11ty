What we eat is completely related to the culture in which we grow up. Few reflect on the impact that our diet may have on the planet or on other living creatures.

While modern media has convinced us to eat artificial food like margarine or corn flakes - and they put a lot of effort suppling us with reasons -  few reflect on the actual impact that our food is having on our body, our performance and the way we feel.

Dogs are man best friend right, but so are horses...

We mostly swallow the reasons that came with the food advertising while we rarely stop and think, let alone test if the food is actually doing us any good. This happens because it's complicated to test, it involves abstaining from eating certain foods and find a way to register the test of the food we put in our mouth.

We also delegate to our culture the reasoning behind eating certain foods or say no thanks to others. When we are surrounded by people who feed on certain stuff it becomes normal and accepted that we will eat that too, like a shortcut to thinking and reasoning about it.

Their last moment is frozen in times, to stimulate your appetite.

We are what we eat as individuals and also as societies and this definitely shapes our everyday actions and thinking. So think before you eat... and also after, it might improve your life.

So here is a visual stimulus to enquire further on customary food habits. All shots are from the Tomohon market in Manado, North Sulawesi, Indonesia, where their gourmet food comes from quite unusual sources. Bon app√©tit!

Today was monkey day. Is this dog guessing that tomorrow will be his turn?

You're not really into neither dog nor monkey, how about piton?

Or bat?

Bats are just flying foxes, maybe just easier to catch...

Rats are only smaller rabbits with tiny ears and longer tail.
