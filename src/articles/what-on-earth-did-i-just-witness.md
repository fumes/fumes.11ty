The film, part of &ldquo;Think+ 2012, Shanghai&rdquo; project, take place in a city. All citizens have very big hands. One child, however, is special. He has tiny hands, and his head full of peculiar thoughts. The boy constantly talks to people about these thoughts, but they dislike his long-windedness and eventually ignore him. He is very lonely. The only he does is talking to walls.


_Song transcript:_

Big hands oh big hands,
Fingers dance like Rolling Pin
Nice and swift
Palm feels like Bouncing Bed
Big hands oh Big hands
Apples turn into Gummy Bears
Nice and swift
This is made by &ldquo;Big Hands&rdquo;
