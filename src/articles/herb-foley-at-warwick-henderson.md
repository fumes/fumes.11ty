>"I have been involved in Art all my life. My math teacher told me I would end up on the end of a brush i.e sweeping the roads, a worthy occupation, looking after the environment, and so I have." _Herb Foley_

At Eighty-one, Foley continues to paint daily from his home in Kerkeri, where he relocated after the 2011 Christchurch earthquakes. Surrounded by bush, he is at peace with his favourite muse; bushland.

>“I feel I paint the most important subject matter there is… without it there is nothing”. _Herb Foley_

As an artist who travelled extensively prior to settling in New Zealand in 1973, coming to a new land and experiencing the Pacific light and its environment could only work wonders on **Foley**'s work. He is a master of chiaroscuro, conveying dappled light which he effects with paint splatters.

Starting with earthy tones he stages bright reds and blues between the painted foliage, catching the viewer's eye and surprising us with new palettes.

>“the images are complex patterns of life. Each painting moves from the undergrowth to the treetops... The undergrowth is populated by creatures, all painted with great subtlety and interwoven so the eye makes small discoveries everywhere.’ _TJ McNamara said of Foley’s past works_

In **Herb**’s most recent works his focus has been on scenes from _Kerikeri_ and _Wharepuke_.

Motifs such as wetas, snails, and birds hide in between the leaves and give the viewer a turn of ‘I Spy', spotting the different subject matter.
