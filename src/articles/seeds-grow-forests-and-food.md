A forest planted by humans, then left to nature’s own devices, typically takes at least 100 years to mature.

But what if we could make the process happen ten times faster? In this short talk, eco-entrepreneur (and TED Fellow) **Shubhendu Sharma** explains how to create a mini-forest ecosystem anywhere.


## 2. Grow Your Food

**Britta Riley** wanted to grow her own food (in her tiny apartment). So she and her friends developed a system for growing plants in discarded plastic bottles — researching, testing and tweaking the system using social media, trying many variations at once and quickly arriving at the optimal system. Call it distributed DIY. And the results? Delicious.


## 3. Seed Backup Bank

**Cary Fowler**: One seed at a time, protecting the future of food

The varieties of wheat, corn and rice we grow today may not thrive in a future threatened by climate change. **Cary Fowler** takes us inside a vast global seed bank, buried within a frozen mountain in Norway, that stores a diverse group of food-crop for whatever tomorrow may bring.
