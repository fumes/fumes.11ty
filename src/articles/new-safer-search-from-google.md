Your internet service provider can actually look at what you are searching
Do you want to stop this? Now you can...

Many internet services use what are known as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connections to encrypt information that travels between your computer and their service. Usually recognized by a web address starting with &ldquo;https&rdquo; or a browser lock icon, this technology is regularly used by online banking sites and e-commerce websites.

Early this year, Google's took an important step forward by making SSL the default setting for all Gmail users.
Google's encryption extends beyond login passwords to the entire service.

An new encrypted connection is created between your browser and Google when you use:

<a href="https://www.google.com"  >https://www.google.com</a>

This secured channel helps protect your search terms and your search results pages <strong>from being intercepted</strong> by a third party on your network.

Google will still maintain search data to improve your search quality and to provide better service. Searching over SSL doesn&rsquo;t reduce the data sent to Google &mdash; it only hides that data from third parties who seek it.
