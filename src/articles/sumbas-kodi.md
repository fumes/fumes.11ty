The Sumbanese, led by General Wonokaka, have the distinction of having led the only successful resistance to Dutch colonialism. What is not well known is that General Soekarno later led Indonesia to independence inspired tactically by Wonokaka's insurgency.

Its easy to understand why the Sumbanese were able to defeat the Dutch, as Sumba was and still is an island of fierce warriors. To this day every man and boy can still use a spear and sword with deadly spirited precision, and many are expert horsemen.
