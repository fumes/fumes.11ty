excerpt: "Skin Works is a series of fine-art black-and-white prints by Rokma. While your summer might look pink, you can feel black and white. Shades of grey smoothly attract. Not surviving alone in the jungle, we are moved to seek contact. See with our hands. Feel the importance. Acknowledge. Gravitating culturally around beauty, skin works exploring the vibe, no light needed."

Skin Works is a series of fine-art black-and-white prints by Rokma.

While your summer might look pink, you can feel black and white. Shades of grey smoothly attract. Not surviving alone in the jungle, we are moved to seek contact. See with our hands. Feel the importance. Acknowledge. Gravitating culturally around beauty, skin works exploring the vibe, no light needed.
