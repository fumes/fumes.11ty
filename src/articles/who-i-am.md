## More infos from interesting comments:

Ben Wang, Dec 5 2013
<blockquote>The speech is great, but as a Chinese, I have to inform the audience of the irony fact that the speecher was not really talking in Chinese. His so called "Chinese" was just repeating some certain Chinese words, and it could not be well understood. And the girl was not "interpreting" at all, namely, there's not much logical connections between the "talks" of the two speechers. Actually, they were performing very well.</blockquote>

Taylor Richards Jan 1 2014
<blockquote> No offense intended, the so-called "translator" act was just for a humorous effect. He told the audience that he wasn't actually saying all that in Chinese.</blockquote>

Fornik Tsai, Nov 24 2013
<blockquote>Through my observation, analysis, recording to understand who I am, I learned to understand and explain each person's good and bad side, in my world, I was a spectator of the world.</blockquote>
