# Eyes which make me lower mine

If you look at the bright side of life, your whole life becomes filled with light.

There are a few easy shifts that better take place, in order to create a state of constant awareness of how amazing life is.

Most of the time we only catch a glimpse of how amazing things.

# A laugh that gets lost on his lips

While having a positive attitude doesn’t necessarily make you less stressed, it can give you the tools for an healthy way.

Take a look at the stress, we generate it because we need it.

A positive attitude is accepting that and going past it in your work and personal life.

# Nights of love without end

Having a positive mindset naturally results in a more optimistic view of life.

Rather than thinking “the grass is greener on the other side,” see the green grass around you.

There ain't no negative events, they are all just lessons.

# A great happiness has settled replacing boredom, sorrow, phases happy immensely happy

With a positive attitude, wearing rose-colored glasses, you can see the thoughts behind people’s actions and why they may have acted the way they did.

Rather than jumping to a harmful conclusion, you can empathise with people and consider where they maybe coming from.

# He tells me love words, everyday words and that makes me shiver

It’s always important to take care of both your physical and mental health.

Cos really, you mind and you body aint separated.

# When he takes me in his arms

On a busy day, it can sometimes be difficult to find time for a serious break.

That means leaving the workspace, resign, go to an other contry and start anew, putting away all past information.

You are legally allowed to have a break, and you should never feel like that it can happen later.

# He speaks to me softly

Dont jump into defense. You want a good thing.

No more conflicts in which you partake, no more negativity will surround your life.

# See life through rose-coloured glasses

The world can be a messy, exhausting place sometime.

The first step is understanding that you are in control of your thoughts and how you act towards things that happen.

It’s about changing your habits around your old way of thinking.

So we can make treasure of "La Vie en rose" French for '"Life in pink"', the signature song of popular French singer Édith Piaf, written in 1945.
