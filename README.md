## What?

_Fumes is an online photography magazine broadcasting human interest stories mainly from South East Asia._
_Fumes project was started by two photographers. A metaphor to play with, delivering ideas via images._

♡ Fumes website is now refactored using 11ty.


## Purpose of open sourcing this project

Having the source files of the Fumes project website, the core of the project, out in the open will allow other people or organisations that want to produce journalism to get a head-start on their own sites and see some practices and methods that have worked well for Fumes.

## Reasons for moving from Jekyll to 11ty

This project has been happily using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) for many years. Till it became way to slow, even using --incremental, to the point that was painful. The discovery of [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) was a pleasant surprise for its elasticity, speed and javascript base which allows many customisations.
